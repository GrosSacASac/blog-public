## Cross Platform

Node.js just works on Windows and Linux.

## It's JavaScript

Which means every experienced JavaScript developer can start with Node.js without too much difficulty. And JavaScript is the main programming language of the Web.

## More than a JavaScript engine

It provides function, to write and read files, make http request etc.

## Fast IO

One of the strength, is fast input-output. Streams of data is a built-in type in Node.js land.
This makes it good for web servers that need to use Websocket or HTTP.

## Asynchronous by default

Most function in Node.js are async by default. Which means reading from a file or a http request does not block the rest of the program.

## People started writing cli apps with it

And it is amazing! Remember Java ? With Node.js, just create a single JS file with a few lines of code and voil√† , your cli app is ready.
Just run `node mycli.js`. Oh it already ran in 0.1s.

 - [surge](https://surge.sh/) to deploy any local HTML, CSS, JS file to a website
 - [blog-engine-sac](https://letz.social/blog/b/blog-engine-sac) to create a website from markdown files
 - [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) to optimize svg files
 - and thousands more

## NPM - A node package manager

Publish any JavaScript file to the public registry with ease. Then reuse that file in every project with a simple npm install command.

And install cli apps written by others in a few seconds. [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) for example is used by a lot of companies, just check the sponsors.

And install any function you may need.
Need to check if a string is an email ? [There's a package for that](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=isemail).
Need to parse markdown ? [There's a package for that](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=parse%20markdown).
Need a random image of a cat ? Yep ! [There's a package for that](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-meow).

Npm is so good for productivity, since all these packages can be used as building blocks for rapid software development.

## Electron

Electron is a project anyone can use to develop desktop apps with HTML, CSS, and JS. It combines Chromium, to display the HTML, CSS and Node.js to get file access amongst others. And cross platform of course.


## People who use Node.js

In conclusion we have

 - Node.js back-end developers
 - Cli apps developers
 - Front-end developers to get access to the cli apps and to NPM
 - Front-end developers who write desktop apps with Electron
